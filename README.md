Welcome to my **Swiggy Real Dataset Analysis project!** üöÄ
This repository showcases my work on normalizing a denormalized Swiggy dataset and solving key business problems using structured tables such as **Orders, Customers, Deliveries, Riders, and Restaurants.** By applying data normalization techniques, I optimized data structure and carried out insightful analyses to address real-world challenges faced by food delivery platforms.
Dive into the project to explore how data engineering and analysis come together to drive impactful business solutions!

## Introduction

This project highlights advanced SQL proficiency through the analysis of a Swiggy dataset, encompassing key business domains like Orders, Customers, Deliveries, Riders, and Restaurants. By transforming a denormalized dataset into a structured, normalized format, the project enables comprehensive analysis to address critical business challenges. Leveraging foundational SQL techniques such as **Aggregations and Date Functions,** alongside advanced concepts like **Joins, Subqueries, and Window Functions.**The project delivers actionable insights into customer trends, operational efficiency, and performance metrics. This work demonstrates the ability to apply SQL to real-world datasets for strategic decision-making.

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains code to create the database schema and write queries for analysis.
2. **Dataset**: Real-time data representing swiggy food orders, customer details, deliveries, riders, and restaurant information.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries crafted to solve business problems, each focusing on understanding food delivery platform sales and performance.

- **closing_hours**:Morning closing time
- **evening_opening_hours**:Evening opening time
- **evening_closing_hours**: Evening closing time


### 3. **Orders Table**
- **order_id**: Unique order identifier
- **order_item**: Description of the ordered item(s)
- **order_date**:  Date the order was placed
- **order_time**:  Time the order was placed
- **order_status**: Status of the order (e.g., Delivered, Cancelled)
- **total_amount**: Total amount for the order
- **customer_id**: Linked to `customers` table
- **restaurant_id**: Linked to `restaurants` table

### 4. **Riders Table**
- **rider_id**: Unique identifier for each rider
- **rider_name**:  Name of the rider

## Business Problems

The following queries were created to solve specific business questions. Each query is designed to provide insights based on orders, customers, riders, deliveries and restaurant data.

### Easy 
1. ` Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by the customer "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.`
2. `Find the average order value (AOV) per customer who has placed more than 750 orders. Return: customer_name, AOV(average order value).`
3. `Determine each rider's average delivery time.`
4. `Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed, based on 2-hour intervals`
5. `Rank restaurants by their total revenue from the last year.`
   
### Medium to Hard
1. ` Identify the most popular dish in each city based on the number of orders.`
2. `Calculate each restaurant's growth ratio based on the total number of delivered orders since its joining.`
3. `Calculate each rider's total monthly earnings,assuming they earn 8% of the order amount.`
4. `Find the number of 5-star, 4-star, and 3-star ratings each rider has.Riders receive ratings based on delivery time: ‚óè 5-star: Delivered in less than 15 minutes ‚óè 4-star: Delivered between 15 and 20 minutes ‚óè 3-star: Delivered after 20 minutes`
5. `Identify sales trends by comparing each month's total sales to the previous month.`

## SQL Queries & Analysis

The `analysis.sql` file contains all SQL queries developed for this project. Each query corresponds to a business problem and demonstrates skills in SQL syntax, data filtering, aggregation, grouping, and ordering, as well as more intermediate topics such as Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions.
