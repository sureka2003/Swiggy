## Introduction

This project highlights advanced SQL proficiency through the analysis of a Swiggy dataset, encompassing key business domains like Orders, Customers, Deliveries, Riders, and Restaurants. By transforming a denormalized dataset into a structured, normalized format, the project enables comprehensive analysis to address critical business challenges. Leveraging foundational SQL techniques such as **Aggregations and Date Functions,** alongside advanced concepts like **Joins, Subqueries, and Window Functions.**The project delivers actionable insights into customer trends, operational efficiency, and performance metrics. This work demonstrates the ability to apply SQL to real-world datasets for strategic decision-making.

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains code to create the database schema and write queries for analysis.
2. **Dataset**: Real-time data representing swiggy food orders, customer details, deliveries, riders, and restaurant information.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries crafted to solve business problems, each focusing on understanding food delivery platform sales and performance.

- **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **customer_name**: Name of the customer
- **reg_date**: Registration date of the customer

### 2. **Restaurants Table**
- **restaurant_id**: Unique identifier for each restaurant
- **restaurant_name**:Name of the restaurant
- **city**: Location of the restaurant
- **opening_hours**:Morning opening time
- **closing_hours**:Morning closing time
- **evening_opening_hours**:Evening opening time
- **evening_closing_hours**: Evening closing time


### 3. **Orders Table**
- **order_id**: Unique order identifier
- **order_item**: Description of the ordered item(s)
- **order_date**:  Date the order was placed
- **order_time**:  Time the order was placed
- **order_status**: Status of the order (e.g., Delivered, Cancelled)
- **total_amount**: Total amount for the order
- **customer_id**: Linked to `customers` table
- **restaurant_id**: Linked to `restaurants` table

### 4. **Riders Table**
- **rider_id**: Unique identifier for each rider
- **rider_name**:  Name of the rider
- **sign_up**: Date the rider signed up

### 5. **Deliveries Table**

- **rider_id**: Linked to the `riders` table
- **delivery_status**: Status of the delivery 
- **delivery_time**: Time the order was delivered 

## Business Problems

The following queries were created to solve specific business questions. Each query is designed to provide insights based on orders, customers, riders, deliveries and restaurant data.

### Easy 
1. `Add your questions here`
2. `Add your questions here`
3. `Add your questions here`
4. `Add your questions here`
5. `Add your questions here`
   
### Medium to Hard
1. `Add your questions here`
2. `Add your questions here`
3. `Add your questions here`
4. `Add your questions here`
5. `Add your questions here`
